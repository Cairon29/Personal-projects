print(type(True)) # = <class 'bool'>
print(type("hello")) # = <class 'str'>
print(type(5 + 5j)) # = <class 'complex'>
print(type(None)) # = <class 'NoneType'> ‚Üê This is a special type in Python, and its the most similar to undefined and null in JS

print(type(int("100"))) # = <class 'int'>
print(type((4 + int("100")))) # = <class 'int'>

# Constants:
MY_SIMULATED_CONSTANT = 100
print(MY_SIMULATED_CONSTANT)
MY_SIMULATED_CONSTANT = 1
print(MY_SIMULATED_CONSTANT) # even though we can change the value of a constant is not recomended
