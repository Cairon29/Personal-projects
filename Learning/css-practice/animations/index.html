                <h2>Excercise 1: Transitions and scales</h2>
                <p>
                    In this exercise we are controlling the basic use of transitions on two different buttons. 
                    The first button will change to a different color and scale right after the mouse is hovered over it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, the second button will change same properties with a delay of 0.7secs. 
                </p>
                <div>
                    <button>1</button>
                    <button>2</button>

                        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/elcatalejo.es/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/First-Order-Stormtrooper.png" alt="">
                    </article>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Also, the stormtrooper will change its position and scale when the mouse is hovered over it.
                    Notice that when user hovers over the image the stormtrooper <b> does not go out of its box.</b>
                    <br>
                    This happens because the box has the property of  <b>overflow: hidden</b>.
                </p>
                <div id="spin-1"></div>
                <p>In this example we wil have 3 divs which are going to look like a menu icon, and when you hover over it, it will change to a close icon.</p>
                <div>

                    <button id="menu-6-button">
                        <div class="menu-6"></div>
                        <div class="menu-6"> </div>
                        <div class="menu-6"></div>
                    </button>
                </div>

                <h2> Excercise 2: background animations</h2>
                <p>
                    In this exercise we have a div with a background image. Our Darth Vader inside a box wihtout any effect is the image inside the <b>div</b>.
                </p>
                <div class="vader"></div>
                <p>
                    In the second image we have the same vader as a background image but this time with a <b>linear gradient in its background</b>
                </p>
                <div class="vader2"></div>
                <p>
                    In the third image we have the same vader as a background image but this time with a moving effect that is infinite. This is working with the <b>keyframes</b> property.
                    <br>
                    Besides, when you <b>hover</b> vader it will turn bigger.
                    Vader also has a <b>background-blend-mode</b> property that makes the background image and the background color to be mixed together. The property used in the background-blend-mode is <b>darken</b> which makes Vader image look different than the others.
                </p>
                <div class="vader3"></div>

                <h2>Excercise 3: ::before and ::after pseudo elements</h2>
                <p>In this exercises we are going to be using the <b>::before</b> and <b>::after</b> pseudo elements to create a simple animation for some HTML elements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <p>In this first exercise we can see an ASCII emoji wrapped in a <b>"h3"</b> tag which has a text in its left-side. The text is being injected right behind the <b>h3</b> element using the <b>::before</b> pseudo element. <b>::before</b> places the content before the parent element itself.</p>
                <h3 id="ascii-1">
                    ⊂(◉‿◉)つ
                </h3>

                <br>

                <p>
                    In this second exercise we will show how the <b>::before</b> works by default. In this example the pseudo element will have a width and height of 10px to be seen by the user. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The little box is being placed in the top right of the pattern element trough the <b>top right</b> property along the position <b>relative</b> of its pattern and the position <b>absolute</b> of the pseudo element.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ascii-2">
                    ⊂(◉‿◉)つ
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In this example we are putting into practice the <b>scale</b>, <b>position relative and absolute</b> and <b>linear gradient</b> properties to make an appearing bar that shows up when you hover the element.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ascii-3">
                    ⊂(◉‿◉)つ
                </h3>

            <article id="exc-4">
                <h2>Excercise 4: Key frames</h2>
                <p><b>Keyframes</b> are used to define the animation of an element. They are used to define the different states of an animation. For example, you can define the initial state of an elementn, the state when the animation is in progress and the final state of the animation.</p>
                <p>In this first box we are changing its background color as we do with transitions. Notice that the animation will be played only once. This Happends because we are using the <b>animation</b> without telling it to repeat.</p>
                <p>We represent the state of the animation through <b>percentages</b>. In this case the <b>0%</b> will have a light red background color, the <b>50%</b> a light blue background and the <b>100%</b> will have a light green background color.
                Once the animation is done, the element will return to its initial state (light red)</p>
                </p>
                <div id="keyframes-1"></div>
                <br>
                <p>In the second exercise we are spining a div with <b>keyframes</b> along the <b>transform</b> and <b>rotate</b> css tags.</p>
                <p>As it can be seen, when the square finishes a rotation the color will go back to its initial state.</p>
                <div id="keyframes-2"></div>
                <br>
                <p>Knowing that the square is only going forwards in its animation we can try to make it turn forward an backwards once it has finished its rotation with the <b>alternate</b> property.</p>
                <div id="keyframes-3"></div>
                <p>In this box we will play with <b>hover</b> and <b>animations</b>. Once you hover it will start spining.</p>
                <div id="keyframes-4"></div>
                <p>In this example the box will be moved to the right and then back to its initial position.</p>
                <div id="keyframes-5"></div>
