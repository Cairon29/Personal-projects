                <p>
                    In this exercise we are controlling the basic use of transitions on two different buttons. 
                    The first button will change to a different color and scale right after the mouse is hovered over it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, the second button will change same properties with a delay of 0.7secs. 
                </p>
                <div>
                    <button>1</button>
                    <button>2</button>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Also, the stormtrooper will change its position and scale when the mouse is hovered over it.
                    Notice that when user hovers over the image the stormtrooper <b> does not go out of its box.</b>
                    <br>
                    This happens because the box has the property of  <b>overflow: hidden</b>.

                <h2> Excercise 2 </h2>
                <p>
                    In this exercise we have a div with a background image. Our Darth Vader inside a box wihtout any effect is the image inside the <b>div</b>.
                </p>
                <div class="vader"></div>
                <p>
                    In the second image we have the same vader as a background image but this time with a <b>linear gradient in its background</b>
                </p>
                <div class="vader2"></div>
                <p>
                    In the third image we have the same vader as a background image but this time with a moving effect that is infinite. This is working with the <b>keyframes</b> property.
                    <br>
                    Besides, when you <b>hover</b> vader it will turn bigger.
                    Vader also has a <b>background-blend-mode</b> property that makes the background image and the background color to be mixed together. The property used in the background-blend-mode is <b>darken</b> which makes Vader image look different than the others.
                </p>
                <div class="vader3"></div>

            <article id="exc-3">
                <h2>Excercise 3</h2>
                <p>In this exercises we are going to be using the <b>::before</b> and <b>::after</b> pseudo elements to create a simple animation for some HTML elements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <p>In this first exercise we can see an ASCII emoji wrapped in a <b>"h3"</b> tag which has a text in its left-side. The text is being injected right behind the <b>h3</b> element using the <b>::before</b> pseudo element. <b>::before</b> places the content before the parent element itself.</p>
                <h3 id="ascii-1">
                    ⊂(◉‿◉)つ
                </h3>

                <br>

                <p>
                    In this second exercise we will show how the <b>::before</b> works by default. In this example the pseudo element will have a width and height of 10px to be seen by the user. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The little box is being placed in the top right of the pattern element trough the <b>top right</b> property along the position <b>relative</b> of its pattern and the position <b>absolute</b> of the pseudo element.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ascii-2">
                    ⊂(◉‿◉)つ
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In this example we are putting into practice the <b>scale</b>, <b>position relative and absolute</b> and <b>linear gradient</b> properties to make an appearing bar that shows up when you hover the element.
                </p>
                <h3 id="ascii-3">
                    ⊂(◉‿◉)つ
                </h3>
